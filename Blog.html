        <img src="img/Flipkart.png" class="img-style">
        <p class="p-text">The king of Indian ecommerce holds second place in website popularity. 
            <br>Flipkart insists that is because it is pushing more towards app transactions, 
            <br>where the company beats Amazon. Many industry analysts, however, think while mobile 
            <br>commerce is the way to the future, it is too early to discount website business. 
            <br>Flipkart, valued at around US$15 billion, leads the ecommerce pack in the country, but 
            <br>is under pressure to maintain that lead as Amazon nips in.

        <p class="p-text">Surprised? Donâ€™t be. 
            <br>Alibaba does not have an Indian website, and one does not see 
            <br>ads asking Indians to buy on Alibaba, but customers here 
            <br>have long discovered the benefits of getting electronics and bulk 
            <br>purchases done on this online megastore. Shipping via Aliexpress 
            <br>is gaining popularity as well.
